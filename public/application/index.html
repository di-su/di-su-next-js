          <h1>Hello! I'm Di üëã</h1>
          <h2>This is my application to Founders and Coders, Spring 2021</h2>
          <p>I'm applying for Founders and Coders because I'm serious about pursuing a career in web development. I'm really excited about the idea of collaborative, peer-led learning and I feel it's an environment that I will thrive in.</p>
          <p>A little about me: I'm a 27 year old Finance & Business graduate from the University of Sussex. I grew up on a council estate in South East London, and I owe everything to my hard-working parents. Despite growing up on low income with government benefits, my parents always made sure that my sister and I had what we needed to succeed in our work and studies.</p> 
          <p>My latest/current role is as Head of Marketing @ <a target="_blank "href="https://www.cornerstone.co.uk/">Cornerstone.co.uk</a>, a D2C subscription-based startup based in London. As a small company of less than 10 people, I've had the opportunity to learn a huge amount around all things tech and business in only a few years.</p>
          <p>I joined Cornerstone as a Customer Support agent, with <u>0 development and marketing experience</u>. Through great opportunity, consistent effort and dedication, today I've become a successful, technical marketer.</p>
          <p>I've made countless marketing landing pages and emails using HTML & CSS. I work closely with our in-house developers (working with Agile, overseeing sprints & creating comprehensive tickets). I have also made small deployments to our codebase with Github. I've worked with Shopify, Mailchimp, AWS and SQL too. I've had the opportunity to learn a lot of development skills within my marketing role, and I've come to find a passion for it. This has led me to search for ways to move into web development as a career.</p>
          <p>When I came across Founders and Coders, I knew it was special - I couldn't miss the incredible opportunity. With some background experience and determination to make this application, I completed all application requirements in around 3 weeks.</p>
          <p>I want to prove that it's possible to make a career shift with enough passion and determination to work hard. I also want to join a community of like-minded individuals. I really hope to hear from you!</p>
          <p>Thank you, Di</p>
          <p>P.S. This site is hosted on Netlify, with source files in my GitHub repository.</p>
