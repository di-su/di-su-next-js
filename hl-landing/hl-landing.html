					<h1>Powerful Products, Trusted by Millions.</h1>
					<p>You may not be familiar with Minoxidil and Finasteride, but <i>millions</i> of men around the world rely on them every day to fight back against hair loss.</p>
					<p>Minoxidil is the active ingredient in Regaine â€“ one of the most popular high street hair loss remedies. The difference? Our Cornerstone product is <strong>30% stronger</strong> (it contains 6.5% Minoxidil vs 5% in Regaine) and is mixed with additional compounds to support hair follicle growth such as Azelaic Acid.</p>
					<p>Finasteride is the active ingredient in Propecia â€“ a widely used medication to slow down and reverse hair loss.</p>

		<h2>Hair loss questions</h2>
		<button class="accordion">What causes hair loss?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Male pattern baldness is caused by testosterone being converted by the body into a compound called DHT. DHT can block your hair follicles from receiving enough blood flow and nutrients to function normally. Over time the hair follicles shrink (leading to thinning hair) and eventually close (leading to baldness).</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Is hair loss genetic?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Not all hair loss cases are genetic, however Male Pattern Baldness, the most common type of hair loss in men, is genetic. It is essentially down to a combination of genetics and the hormone DHT. There are two licensed medications, Finasteride and Minoxidil which are used to slow the progression (and in some cases stop progression) as well as promote hair growth, with results varying between patients.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Product effectiveness questions</h2>
		<button class="accordion">How effective are your products?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Both Finasteride and Minoxidil have been shown to be effective at treating male hair loss in clinical trials. However, results cannot be guaranteed - if your hair loss is already very severe treatment may be less effective.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How does Finasteride work?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Finasteride works by slowing down the process of testosterone conversion into DHT. This means there is less DHT in your blood to negatively affect the functioning of your hair follicles. We recommend one Finasteride tablet per day.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How does Minoxidil work?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>When sprayed on your scalp, Minoxidil helps increase blood flow to the hair follicles, giving them more nutrients and the right conditions to support hair regrowth. We recommend 10-12 sprays onto your scalp twice a day.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Can your products treat Alopecia or hair loss caused by medication such as chemotherapy?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>No.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Will the treatment allow hair to regrow in areas where itâ€™s disappeared?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Areas that are smooth, shiny and have no hair growing, cannot be recovered as there are no longer any active hair follicles. For this reason we recommend starting treatment as soon as you start noticing your hair thinning.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How long does your treatment take to work?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Like any medication, our products are not guaranteed to be effective for everyone. However, if the medication is effective, you should start to notice diminished hair loss and hair re-growth within 3-4 months.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Is it true that you can actually lose more hair in the early stages of treatment?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>As your hair follicles are stimulated by the treatment, this can cause the hair regrowth cycle to accelerate â€“ often this is accompanied by a shedding of old hairs. Donâ€™t worry â€“ this is a positive sign that your body is reacting to the treatment â€“ these hairs will return thicker and stronger. During this phase, stick with the treatment.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Do I have to keep taking the treatment?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>If you stop taking the medication your hair loss will eventually revert to what it was like before you started taking the medication.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How is your Minoxidil product different to Regaine?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Our Minoxidil product contains the same active ingredient as Regaine, but at a 30% higher concentration. Our product is also mixed with caffeine and Azelaic Acid â€“ two known DHT inhibitors, to help your hair follicles regrow hair. Our Minoxidil product is only available via prescription, whereas Regaine can be bought off the shelf in many high street pharmacies.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How is your Finasteride product different to Propecia?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>The two products are chemically identical. Propecia is just the brand name given to the original product when it was invented â€“ now that the patent has expired, any company can sell Finasteride.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Purchasing questions</h2>
		<button class="accordion">Where will my medicine come from?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>We've teamed up with one of the UKâ€™s leading online pharmacies - regulated by the CQC and GPHC. Their team of fully-qualified doctors and pharmacists write and dispense all of our medication prescriptions.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Do I need a prescription to buy Minoxidil and Finasteride tablets?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Yes - if they think itâ€™s safe, our doctors will write a private prescription for you after youâ€™ve answered our confidential online medical questionnaire. Your medication will then be sent straight out to you in the post.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Safety questions</h2>
		<button class="accordion">What are the safety warnings and common side effects of Minoxidil?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>It is important to read the patient information leaflets supplied before starting treatment and to familiarise yourself with associated side effects.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Finasteride is not for use in women or males under the age of 18.</li>
				<li>If going for a PSA test, then you must stop Finasteride 1 week before. This is important as Finasteride can mask the markers identified in a PSA test.</li>
				<li>For men that donate blood, Finasteride should be stopped 4 weeks before giving blood. This is to ensure that there are no traces of Finasteride in the donated blood.</li>
				<li>Finasteride should not be used in any one who suffers from or who has a history of anxiety / depression.</li>
				<li>Finasteride should not be used in any one with liver problems.</li>
				<li>Finasteride should not be used in any one who has or has had Gynecomastia / issues with fatty tissue or lumps in breast tissue.</li>
				<li>Finasteride should not be used whilst trying to conceive.</li>
				<li>Finasteride should not be used in any one who is also using testosterone replacement therapy.</li>
				<li>Finasteride should not be used in anyone who has had a history of prostate cancer.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Common side effects of Finasteride can include an increase in depressed mood / anxiety, lowered libido, changes in breast tissue, testicular pain, difficulty in achieving an erection and low semen production. Studies have shown that these occur in less than 2% of patients, however, if you do experience any of these side effects then you must stop taking the tablets and seek medical advice. The full list of side effects are detailed in the patient information leaflet supplied. The patient information leaflet provided should be read before starting treatment.
			</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">What are the safety warnings and common side effects of Finasteride?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>It is important to read the patient information leaflets supplied before starting treatment and to familiarise yourself with associated side effects.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Minoxidil should not be applied to irritated or inflamed skin.</li>
				<li>If you get Minoxidil in your eyes, you should wash it out immediately and seek medical advice.</li>
				<li>Minoxidil can lead to unwanted facial hair growth if it comes into contact with the skin. If the minoxidil runs onto the face you should wash it off immediately.</li>
				<li>When starting on Minoxidil, you can go through an initial shedding phase and lose more hair to begin with. This should slow down and stop around week 12. If you stop using Minoxidil, you can go through another shedding phase and then hair loss can continue to progress at the same rate as it did before starting on treatment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Common side effects are usually mild and can include skin irritation, headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, swollen hands or feet, heart palpitations, shortness of breath and chest pain. The side effects are unlikely and should wear off quickly after stopping using the medication. It is important that you read the patient information leaflet supplied before starting treatment.
