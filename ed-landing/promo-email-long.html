                  A pharmacy would normally charge £60 for 8x 50mg Viagra

          <p>
            The main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to
            get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse.
          </p>
          <p>
            ED should not be confused with ejaculation problems such as
            premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of
            arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly.

        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            A significant cause of erectile dysfunction is the narrowing of
            blood vessels that feed the penis, which restricts blood flow and
            makes it difficult to achieve an erection.

          What's the difference between Sildenafil and Viagra?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            The active ingredients in Sildenafil are
            <strong>identical</strong> to Viagra. Viagra is simply a branded,
            more expensive version.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viagra is the brand name that Pfizer (the original company that
            discovered the chemical and marketed this type of medication) gave
            to the product. Once Pfizer's patent expired in 2013, other
            manufacturers aside from Pfizer were able to produce and sell
            medication containing sildenafil, but still are not allowed to use
            the Viagra brand name.

        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Sildenafil works by expanding the blood vessels that feed the penis
            - this increased amount of blood allows for a stronger erection when
            you are sexually aroused.

          <p>
            As a general rule you should take sildenafil tablets up to 1 hour
            before having sex. If the medication works correctly, when you are
            sexually aroused you will be able to get and maintain an erection.

          <p>
            Sildenafil (and other ED treatments) are not always effective for
            everyone the first time they take them. You should try a tablet on
            up to 8 different occasions before deciding that it is ineffective.
            At this point, you can opt to either increase the strength to 100mg
            or speak to your doctor about alternative treatment options.

        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            The difference is the amount of active ingredient - if you've never
            had ED treatment before, it's recommended that you begin with 50mg,
            and only switch to 100mg if this does not have an effect after 8
            separate attempts. You can change your strength at any time.

        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            No - clinical studies have shown that doses above 100mg of
            Sildenafil are no more effective at producing an erection but
            significantly increase the chances of side effects. You should not
            take more than 100mg of sildenafil in a 24-hour period.

          What dosage should I take?

            The starting dose for most men is 50mg. If 50mg does not have an
            effect after 8 separate attempts, then switch to 100mg. If you have
            existing heart conditions, you should talk to your doctor about
            starting sildenafil - they may decide that 25mg is a better option
            for you.

            You should avoid the following: Nitrates (glyceryl trinitrate spray
            & isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate), Poppers (amyl nitrate),
            Protease inhibitors (HIV treatment) and Alpha-blockers (doxazosin,
            prazosin, or terazosin).
          </p>
          <p>
            As all ED treatments work in a similar way, you should not take any
            other ED treatments (such as Viagra, Cialis, Tadalafil, or Levitra)
            within 24 hours of sildenafil. Always speak to your doctor or
            pharmacist before seeking alternative ED treatments.
