            <h2 id="24-referral">24. Referral</h2>
            <p>24.1 Our Refer A Friend scheme is a genuine and generous offer for our members - rewarding them for introducing Cornerstone to friends and family. We have tried to make it easy to follow and rewarding. Unfortunately, there will always be people that take advantage of and abuse that generosity, so there are a few house rules.</p>
            <p>24.2 You may only receive referral credit when your friends and family sign up for a Cornerstone shave plan following your unique referral link. You will not receive credit should your friends and family order a Cornerstone gift box following your unique referral link.</p>
            <p>24.3 Each member is permitted to refer a maximum of 10 friends and to earn a maximum of £100 referral credit. We may, at our discretion, allow members to refer more than 10 friends and to benefit from any subsequent referral bonuses, but this is in our power to grant and can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
            <p>24.4 You may refer a maximum of one person per household - anything more than this and we may decide to count this as a fraudulent referral. You may also not refer yourself - if we suspect you have used different email addresses or delivery addresses to circumvent our system, we may decide to count this as a fraudulent referral. For any referral which we deem to be fraudulent, we reserve the right to cancel the referred transaction, and to refuse to credit your existing account with any referral credit."</p>
            <p>24.5 You may not use more than £50 of referral credit within the same calendar month for orders placed with us.</p>
            <p>24.6 All referral credit will expire after 24 months if not used.</p>
            <p>24.7 In your manner of sharing your referral link, you may not mimic or misrepresent Cornerstone or otherwise mislead people to believe that they are dealing with Cornerstone, one of our agents or affiliates.</p>
