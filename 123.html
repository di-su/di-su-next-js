      <button class="accordion ga-event" data-event-category="faq" data-event-label="What are the symptoms of erectile dysfunction?"> What are the symptoms of erectile dysfunction? </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> The main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse. </p>
        <p> ED should not be confused with ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion ga-event" data-event-category="faq" data-event-label="What causes erectile dysfunction?">What causes erectile dysfunction?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> A significant cause of erectile dysfunction is the narrowing of blood vessels that feed the penis, which restricts blood flow and makes it difficult to achieve an erection. </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Product questions</h2>
      <button class="accordion ga-event" data-event-category="faq" data-event-label="What's the difference between Sildenafil and Viagra?"> What's the difference between Sildenafil and Viagra? </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> The active ingredients in Sildenafil are 
          <strong>identical</strong> to Viagra. Viagra is simply a branded, more expensive version. 
        </p>
        <p> Viagra is the brand name that Pfizer (the original company that discovered the chemical and marketed this type of medication) gave to the product. Once Pfizer’s patent expired in 2013, other manufacturers aside from Pfizer were able to produce and sell medication containing sildenafil, but still are not allowed to use the Viagra brand name. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion ga-event" data-event-category="faq" data-event-label="How does Sildenafil work?">How does Sildenafil work?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> Sildenafil works by expanding the blood vessels that feed the penis - this increased amount of blood allows for a stronger erection when you are sexually aroused. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion ga-event" data-event-category="faq" data-event-label="How long does it take to work?">How long does it take to work?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> As a general rule you should take sildenafil tablets up to 1 hour before having sex. If the medication works correctly, when you are sexually aroused you will be able to get and maintain an erection. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion ga-event" data-event-category="faq" data-event-label="How long does it last?">How long does it last?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> You should be able to achieve a satisfactory erection for 4-6 hours after taking a Sildenafil tablet. Your erection will go down after ejaculation. </p>

      <button class="accordion ga-event" data-event-category="faq" data-event-label="What happens if it doesn't work?">What happens if it doesn't work?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> Sildenafil (and other ED treatments) are not always effective for everyone the first time they take them. You should try a tablet on up to 8 different occasions before deciding that it is ineffective. At this point, you can opt to either increase the strength to 100mg or speak to your doctor about alternative treatment options. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion ga-event" data-event-category="faq" data-event-label="What's the difference between 50mg and 100mg?">What's the difference between 50mg and 100mg?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> The difference is the amount of active ingredient - if you've never had ED treatment before, it's recommended that you begin with 50mg, and only switch to 100mg if this does not have an effect after 8 separate attempts. You can change your strength at any time. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion ga-event" data-event-category="faq" data-event-label="Will taking more than 100mg of sildenafil give me a better erection?"> Will taking more than 100mg of sildenafil give me a better erection? </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> No - clinical studies have shown that doses above 100mg of Sildenafil are no more effective at producing an erection but significantly increase the chances of side effects. You should not take more than 100mg of sildenafil in a 24-hour period. </p>

        <p> We've teamed up with one of the UK’s leading online pharmacies - regulated by the CQC and GPhC. Their team of fully-qualified doctors and pharmacists write and dispense all of our medication prescriptions. </p>

        <p> Yes - if they think it’s safe, our doctors will write a private prescription for you after you’ve answered our confidential online medical questionnaire.

      <div class="panel">
        <p> The starting dose for most men is 50mg. If 50mg does not have an effect after 8 separate attempts, then switch to 100mg. If you have existing heart conditions, you should talk to your doctor about starting sildenafil - they may decide that 25mg is a better option for you. </p>

        <p> You should avoid the following: Nitrates (glyceryl trinitrate spray & isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate), Poppers (amyl nitrate), Protease inhibitors (HIV treatment) and Alpha-blockers (doxazosin, prazosin, or terazosin). </p>
        <p> As all ED treatments work in a similar way, you should not take any other ED treatments (such as Viagra, Cialis, Tadalafil, or Levitra) within 24 hours of sildenafil. Always speak to your doctor or pharmacist before seeking alternative ED treatments. </p>
